// The Temporal Dead Zone is a behaviour in JavaScript that occurs when 
// declaring variables using let and const. It refers to the period between
//  entering the scope and the actual declaration of the variable.
//  During this period, the variable cannot be accessed and will throw a ReferenceError if you try to use it.
